## Description

**Secure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Decentralized Vaults**

FHE Vault offers a robust Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solution, integrated with decentralized vaults for enhanced security. Users can sign up with their wallet on Zama Testnet or any supported FHEVM, setting up a passcode to access their MFA page. Once unlocked, users can seamlessly add their decentralized applications (DApps) for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). The Fluf Authenticator generates unique 2FA codes using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) cryptography, ensuring unparalleled protection for accessing private vaults.

## Installation

Using git submodules we need to fetch the different components for this project. We can clone the repository then fetch the submodules.

```
git clone https://github.com/BruhmaHQ/fhe-vault.git
cd fhe-vault
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Server Setup**
Use the .example.env to setup your local enviornment

```
cd fluf-id-backend
npm i
npm start
```

**Client Setup**

` cd fluf-id-client` or ` cd fluf-vault-client`

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## UX Flow

1.  **Sign Up with Fluf-ID Client:**

    - User visits the Fluf-ID Client interface.
    - They initiate the sign-up process by connecting their wallet to the Zama Testnet (or any supported FHEVM).
    - During sign-up, the user sets up a passcode which will act as a gate for accessing their MFA page.

2.  **MFA Page Setup:**

    - After successful sign-up, the user gains access to their MFA page.
    - They unlock the MFA page using the passcode they set up earlier.
    - Once unlocked, they proceed to set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for additional security.

3.  **Adding DApp for 2FA:**

    - Within the MFA page, the user has the option to add their DApp (Decentralized Application) for Two-Factor Authentication.
    - They select the option to add a new DApp.
    - The user inputs the necessary information or scans a QR code provided by the DApp to register it with the Fluf Authenticator.

4.  **Generating 2FA Code:**

    - Upon successful registration of the DApp, the user is now ready to use 2FA for accessing their private vault.
    - Whenever they want to login to access their vault, they navigate to the FHE Vault login page.
    - They input their credentials (e.g., username and password).
    - The login process prompts them for 2FA.
    - The Fluf Authenticator generates a unique 2FA code using FHE cryptography for the specific DApp associated with the vault.

5.  **Authentication and Access:**

    - The user inputs the 2FA code generated by the Fluf Authenticator using FHE.
    - Upon successful authentication, the user gains access to their private vault.
    - They can now securely view and manage their encrypted data stored within the vault.

## Architecture

Tech Stack : NextJS, TypeScript, NodeJS, Solidity, TailwindCSS

## Future Goals

Our goal is to create an Mobile or Progressive Web App (PWA) for the On-Chain Authenticator, providing users with seamless access to their authentication keys stored securely on the blockchain. Additionally, we aim to create a SDK, enabling decentralized applications to integrate on-chain Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) effortlessly.
